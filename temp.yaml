            Step 1: Call FalsePositiveDetector with:
              - src_ip
              - dest_ip
              - src_port
              - dest_port

              - portUsage_src
              - portUsage_dest
              - history

            Step 2: If the verdict from FalsePositiveDetector is "False Positive", call IPTrustClassifier.ClassifyIP with:
              - ipAddress = src_ip

            Step 3: If the classification from ClassifyIP is "trusted" or "internal", call RuleRecommender with:
              - src_ip
              - dest_ip
              - src_port
              - dest_port

              - packets
              - portUsage_src
              - portUsage_dest
              - history

            Step 4: Save the output from RuleRecommender as rulePatch.

            Step 5: If rulePatch is not empty, call FirewallRulePatcher with:
              - nsg_name
              - rule_name
              - priority
              - direction

              - protocol
              - source = src_ip
              - destination = dest_ip
              - port = dest_port
